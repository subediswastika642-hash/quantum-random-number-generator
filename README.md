# Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains our Hackathon 2025 project: a **Quantum Random Number Generator (QRNG)** built using Qiskit.  
Unlike classical random number generators, which rely on deterministic algorithms, this project leverages **quantum superposition and measurement** to produce truly random outcomes.

## 🎯 Hackathon Prompt
Random number generators are essential for computing, especially in security and cryptography.  
Classical generators are pseudo-random, but quantum systems can produce truly random outcomes.  

**Your challenge:**  
- Create a quantum circuit that generates random numbers.  
- Decide the number of qubits and possible outcomes (`n`).  
- Use **Hadamard (H) gates** to prepare a superposition state with `n` equally likely outcomes.  
- Map measured states to numeric values so your program prints a random number.


## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Dhakal-Unique/quantum-random-number-generator.git
   cd quantum-random-number-generator



---

### 4. **Usage Example**
```markdown
## ▶️ Usage Example
```python
from qrng.runner import run_qrng

# Generate a random number with 3 qubits and 100 shots
result = run_qrng(num_outcomes=8, shots=100)
print("Random number:", result)
```






### 5. **Tips & Deeper Questions**
```markdown
## 💡 Tips
- Run once (single shot) → one random number.  
- Run multiple shots → shows fairness of distribution.  
- Noise may bias results → explore error mitigation.

## 🔍 Deeper Questions
- Why do some values appear more often?  
- Which error mitigation techniques make results fairer?
